9. in order for the script to execute on a time-based, you must create a cron job task for it,

   Navigate to **Worker > Triggers > Cron Triggers** and create a new cron trigger

   Examples:

   `0 0 * * *` will cause the script to execute once everyday.

   `0 0 */10 * *` will cause the script to execute once every ten days

   `0 0 1 * *` will cause the script to run on a monthly basis.

## Change export type to `Markdown`

To change the backup's export format from html to markdown or PDF (enterprise plan), create a new environment variable called EXPORT TYPE and set its value to `html` or `markdown`.
